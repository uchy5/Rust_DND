Hello people, this is a project of Rust coding on what I learned and How I decided to code it and outlayed it as well.
Rust is a Combination of C# and C++ and Python, But it has its own twist to it. If you have learned languages before,
I recommend this to be at an intermediate level of coding. I had a OK time finding resources online to learn how to 
code Rust. Overall a lot of people say do not learn Rust, and that it is very messy but that it has its own type of 
flavor. What is nice about Rust is that you can reuse names and variables by using the mut function, giving it a call 
in the code that it is being reused, not that it's being reused but it is being borrowed until that code is executed. 
So whatever variable name you use, the first one to use that variable is the owner, so when borrowing understand that 
once that's run through it'll return to its owner. I learned that REST is case sensitive and indeed needs tabs as 
well and arrows. For the most part the language is pretty similar to the rest of the languages that I have listed I am
not sure if I will ever go back to Rust but it is interesting in its own way and can kind of make sense. I see why it 
is not a language for beginners and why it's one that you shouldn't learn when you start, If you did start with this 
language it is hard to transition to all the multiple other languages that are similar to each other but just have a 
little bit of different functions, whereas rush similar to languages but then is very different on its own and has its 
own rules and is also very hard to run in a terminal, you can get lost pretty easily if you struggle with getting lost 
or learning how to run your project, I would suggest looking it up or asking AI for help.
